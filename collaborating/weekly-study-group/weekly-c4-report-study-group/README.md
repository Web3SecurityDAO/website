Friday: We will try to see if there are any more members that have questions on report, if we find something intresting and think it will benifit the group greatly we will make a quiz related to the subject for that weekend.




Topics



We discuss a wide variety of topics in the discord channel from L,M,H findings to tools that can be used with and best practice procedures. It is open discussion so please keep the discussion focused on that report for the week. 

Please be considerate of others and questions they have. This study club is meant for any level of auditor to join, as the group grows we will move to organize level of auditors better so the chat can relate better to reports.

Previous weeks study clubs will be available in the pinned section of the channel so you can reference back to a report from earlier and find what you need.

If you have any questions please reach out in the discord to members running the channel, they will be tagged at the begining of every report on mondays.
